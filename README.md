# Gnuplot drone

##Task 
My task was to create a simple 3D library based on [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/). Then a simple drone simulation had to be made along with animation. The dron should also avoid obstacles which could be created and removed from the scene. Dr Arkadiusz Mielczarek and Dr Bogdan Kreczmer provided us _lacze_do_gnuplota_ and _API_


## Running the program
To run this program you need to install gnuplot.
After cloning the repository simply run ` make ` command. Later you can run the program using `./DragonFly.out'.
